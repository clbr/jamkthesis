Introduction
------------

Graphics cards carry some fast, dedicated memory (VRAM). This memory is used to speed up 
tasks such as rendering or parallel computations, by avoiding the latency in having the 
graphics card access the system memory.

VRAM is a limited resource, and as such, all workloads may not fit in a given graphics 
card. In a situation like that, the strategy that decides what parts of the working set to 
keep in VRAM, and which parts can be kept in regular system RAM, is of utmost importance.

If the application needs to access a specific resource in system RAM, it will have a 
corresponding hit in its performance. The VRAM placement strategy should try to rank the 
application's buffers in such a way to maximize the application's performance.

Application performance is commonly measured in two ways: throughput (FPS, frames per 
second) and smoothness (how stable the FPS is). For a good user experience, they both 
must be above some user-dependent threshold.

There are no generally accepted guidelines, as the minimum for an acceptable experience is 
quite subjective. However, many people place the line at 60 FPS with a minimum FPS of 55.
(Minimum playable FPS 2012)

Both throughput and smoothness must be above the user's minimum requirements, one alone will 
not suffice. For example, a game running at a healthy throughput of 60 FPS, but dipping to 
10 FPS once per second will be extremely irritating, perceived as stalling or stuttering. 
Vice versa, a smooth FPS of 20 will not stutter, but the throughput is not high enough for 
an enjoyable experience, as the user will notice individual images instead of the illusion 
of movement.

Problem background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The open source graphics drivers on Linux are generally thought of as lower performance, but 
higher stability, than the proprietary drivers provided by the graphics card companies. This 
is a result of the bar for quality in public work; each new version of a proprietary driver 
generally includes many application-specific changes (Catalyst 13.1 release notes 2013), 
which would not fly in an open-source driver.

Recent advances in optimization have brought the r600g driver close to competing with the 
proprietary Catalyst driver (Larabel 2013a). Depending on the benchmark and hardware, it 
is within 60% - 110% of the Catalyst driver, generally around 80%.

One of the remaining areas yet to be optimized is the VRAM placing strategy. In this 
thesis, research will be done on improving this area of the r600g driver.

There are some practical constraints that the solution will need to abide by. First, there 
is no central location with a holistic view of everything that happens on the graphics card. 
Secondly, the run-time performance of the strategy itself must be adequate. It may have to 
make thousands of decisions per second; having performance go down because the computer is 
thinking on how to improve performance would be counterproductive.

A perfect solution would know everything that goes on in the system. It could predict 
exactly what the application will do next, and in what way does it access each buffer. 
Sadly, either of those is a luxury not available in the real world.

While recording the way the application accesses each buffer is possible in theory, this 
would incur more overhead than could be gained. Thus, the strategy is limited to considering 
worst-case possibilities, and has to make decisions as if the application would use each 
buffer fully. In practice, many buffers are not fully read or written, but only parts of 
them are used, for example due to mipmapping.

The current strategy used in r600g is a simple LRU (least recently used) list. While simple, 
it can lead to quite a bad user experience in non-trivial cases that exceed the VRAM size. A 
buffer that is needed next could have been swapped out to system RAM, dropping performance. 
In the worst case, this creates a ping-pong effect where buffers are constantly moved back 
and forth, dropping performance to single digits FPS. (Larabel 2012a; Very low FPS when 
video memory is full (GART & ram <-> vram swapping) 2013)

Given that the absolute knowledge is not available, the system will have to make do with 
what is there. For example, the system can keep accurate statistics on the times the 
application declares it will read from a buffer. Though the system cannot know how much the 
application will read, it does know the application will read from the buffer. Using this 
information, it can make a worst-case estimation that the application will read the buffer 
in full.

Such worst-case estimation will directly improve the minimum FPS; in other words, the 
smoothness. This has an indirect benefit to performance, but optimal performance will not be 
reached by these means.

The target of this work is to improve on the current strategy, particularly in the cases 
that are currently pathological. The improved system may not gain significantly in 
throughput, but it should gain measurably in smoothness.

Problem definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knowing what information the system has available, and with the goals in mind, the problem 
could be defined more clearly.

The component that decides which buffer to place where is separate from the component that 
has access to accurate statistics. Moving information between these components, the kernel 
and the userspace, is expensive; therefore the information moved must be minimized.

According to the privilege separation, userspace should not be able to directly decide a 
placement in memory space, as this could cause security holes. Moving the entire statistics 
data over would be too expensive. How about ranking the buffers, giving each buffer an 
importance score?

This limits the information needed to pass to the kernel to one integer per buffer. In 
addition, the kernel is free to disregard this hint, keeping in line with the separation. 
Having the relative importance of each buffer known, the kernel should be able to make much 
better buffer placing decisions than the current LRU strategy.

While giving each buffer a score could certainly be done by the usual programming 
techniques, linear/weight calculations and a set of if-conditions, it is believed that the 
relationship of the statistics to the buffer's importance is both non-linear and hard to 
model manually.

Given this assumption, it is likely that such a manual method would not do well in many 
cases, and it would be constantly tweaked to accommodate newly discovered pathological cases. 
There is no existing model for a buffer's importance, and no single right answer to the 
question "how important is this buffer?"

The mainstream solution to solving non-linear, unknown models like that (also known as 
modeling or regression problems) is to use AI solutions such as neural networks.

AI theory
---------

There are many approaches to artificial intelligence. What is common to all of them is the 
ability to make decisions the computer was not told explicitly how to do. They differ in 
their areas of usability, theoretic foundations, whether they are based on real biological 
phenomena, and other ways.

One such approach is the neural network. Invented in the 60's, it mimics the 
biological brain cells. Such networks are able to generalize, to learn either independently 
or with guidance, and tend to achieve quite decent results. Neural networks have been 
applied to problems such as Backgammon (Tesauro 1994), business data mining (Bigus 1996), 
and text compression (Mahoney 1996) with success.

Neural networks come in many varieties. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is the most common 
one, used for classification, modeling, and time-series prediction. The radial basis 
function network (RBF) shares the same uses. The adaptive resonance 
theory network and Kohonen map are used for clustering. Recurrent networks are used for 
extremely complex modeling problems. (Bigus 1996, p. 77)

.Multi-layer perceptron.

As the problem here is a modeling one, this narrows the choice to MLP, RBF or recurrent. 

Recurrent networks are generally hard to train, and their runtime performance is not 
deterministic: they may take ten or hundred times longer to make a decision compared to 
another. This rules that model out.

The choice between MLP and RBF is somewhat arbitrary. Liu and Gader (2000) found that RBF 
ignores outliers better, 
while MLP is said to perform better. MLP is also covered more in literature. MLP was chosen 
here for the literature availability.

There are many ways to train a MLP neural network. The algorithms are usually divided into 
four: supervised, unsupervised, competitive, and reinforcement learning (Siddique & Adeli 
2013).

Supervised learning is used when you have clearly labeled test data. For example, if the 
task was to detect if a picture contains a squirrel, you would feed in sets of pictures of 
both squirrels and non-squirrels, each labeled by a human on whether it contains a squirrel. 
Then the network's guesses are compared to the labels, and corrected until the network can 
correctly determine whether a picture contains a small, furry creature or not.

In unsupervised learning, the network is not told anything about the data. It's used mainly 
in clustering problems, where the clusters are not defined beforehand. For example, the 
network may be fed customer data, and asked to segment customers into four classes. Studying 
the decisions it made can be very useful in finding new or undervalued customer segments.

Competitive learning is used in classification problems mainly. Only the neuron that "wins" 
the round, in other words whose guess was closest to correct, gets to be tweaked. This 
results in each neuron specializing to a specific type of input.

Reinforcement learning is used in stateful problems, where each action may not be graded 
alone, but only the full path of actions may be graded. For example, the Backgammon network 
of Tesauro (1994) used this method.

Alternative methods for tweaking the network instead of training it include genetic and 
evolutionary methods.

In the VRAM strategy case the seemingly only option would be reinforcement learning. 
Supervised learning cannot be used, as a human cannot give any buffer an importance score; 
unsupervised and competitive learning do not apply in modeling problems. However, 
reinforcement learning is not a good fit for modeling problems (Wiering, Hasselt, Pietersma, 
& Schomaker 2011). Wiering et al found that while reinforcement learning can be applied to 
such problems, and the result performs on par with a network trained by supervised learning, 
the training was slow, and there is no guarantee that the network will not get stuck in 
local minima.

It was decided to first attempt a Monte-Carlo method, and should that not produce 
satisfactory results, evolutionary training.

Data gathering
--------------

All further steps required data. In the first weeks, the needed data points were planned 
out, and the data gathering was implemented as patches to Mesa. Since it was clear from the 
start that wide coverage would be needed, the public was asked for assistance (Kasanen 2014; 
Dawe 2014).

In addition to data gathered by the researcher, the public sent a wide variety of traces, 
enhancing the coverage much further than would have been possible otherwise. The researcher 
would like to thank all contributors.

To get suitable data for the purposes of this research, the following data points were 
selected as inputs:

- number of reads
- number of writes
- time since last read
- time since last write
- buffer size
- number of processor operations
- time since last processor operation
- whether the buffer should be considered high priority (MSAA, depth)
- VRAM size

Timing information was set at millisecond accuracy. A time measurement was chosen instead of 
the frame number, because it ought to allow for a better user experience. Should frames take 
long, inter-frame swapping should be minimized. Should frames be fast (< 10 ms / frame), 
timing is good as well, since the user experience works on longer timescales.

A game might 
only draw shadows every other frame, or less often; this causes those frames to take longer 
than the frames without such extra work. Yet, the user will notice if every Nth frame is 
too slow. It remains to be seen whether this level of accuracy is good; other choices beside 
the frame number include thresholds determined by common user studies (10 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms, 
100 ms...) or non-linear scaling.

To enable those inputs to be replayed, the memory traces listed each operation on a buffer 
along with timing information.

image::pics/trace.png[]

As the traces took a considerable amount of space in their uncompressed text form, a custom 
binary format was developed. A binary format also allows the traces to be read back much 
faster, an important point for speedy training.

The binary format filled the goals set quite nicely. It resulted in a compression ratio 
better than that of XZ applied on the text form, by a variable amount (1.5 to 12x). 
The compression ratio compared to uncompressed text varied from 150x to 1300x. It 
allows fast reading for the training and fragmentation simulation applications.

Some helper applications were also developed to make it nicer to work with. Figure 4 
above is from one such helper: a reader for the format with color highlighting.

Fragmentation
-------------

Fragmentation is a common problem in all memory management. As buffers get allocated, moved 
around, and deleted, the memory space becomes increasingly fragmented. It limits the maximum 
size of a new allocation, and so buffers bigger than this also cannot be moved to VRAM.
footnote:[The very latest generation, HD 7000, can use non-continuous memory areas with 
small overhead, so this issue is not as pressing there.]

An example of the effects is reported by Larabel (2013b). Big buffer allocations were 
failing due to fragmentation, causing the application to misrender and/or crash.

.Fragmentation
image::pics/fragmentation.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

Fragmentation is an inevitable result of continued use. It can be mitigated by smart 
allocation strategies, and it can be repaired after the fact by moving the used buffers 
together (constraints allowing).

In normal system RAM, both strategies are viable. Cleaning up the memory area, also known as 
compaction (Corbet 2010), can be fairly low-impact to performance. It only involves 
freezing the process, and changing some page table entries, which is a relatively fast 
operation. The downside is that a TLB (translation look-aside buffer) cache flush is needed 
so that the cache doesn't give out the old, wrong addresses.

However, with current graphics cards this is not an option. The page tables reside in VRAM, 
so accessing them on the main processor incurs heavy delays due to having to wait for the 
graphics card to finish its current work, plus the PCI-E bus latency. The delay caused by a 
VRAM 
memory compaction operation may be measured in tens of milliseconds in the worst case, which 
would be unacceptable stutter to the user.

Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~

In order to measure fragmentation in different situations, a simulator was developed. It 
replays the collected memory traces while simulating the VRAM placement using the existing 
LRU strategy. The results will not apply directly to other placing strategies, but they will 
be indicative of general trends regardless of the placing strategy.

The simulator took snapshots of the VRAM state once per every ten memory operations, and 
counted the amount of holes (fragmentation). It also printed a marker every time an eviction 
was triggered.

Two different allocation strategies were tested. The default allocator allocates buffers 
from the start of VRAM. The proposed min-max allocator allocates buffers from two ends of 
the VRAM space, based on the assumptions that smaller buffers are recycled more often than 
large ones, and that recycling of each type would then only create fragmentation of the same 
type.

Nine common VRAM sizes were tested: 64 mb, 128 mb, 256 mb, 384 mb, 512 mb, 1024 mb, 1536 mb,
2048 mb, and 4096 mb. In cases where the trace couldn't run on a configuration, that trace 
was skipped. For example, Planetary Annihilation allocated a buffer of 78 mb in size; it is 
obviously beyond the capabilities of a 64 mb VRAM graphics card.

Several threshold values were tested for the min-max allocator in order to find a rough 
optimum.
